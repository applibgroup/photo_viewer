```
dependencies {

    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar', '*.har'])
    implementation project(path: ':photo_viewer')
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
    ohosTestImplementation 'com.huawei.ohos.testkit:runner:1.0.0.100'
    
    }
```
2. For using Photoviewer module in separate application using har file, add the har file in the entry/libs folder and add the dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.
```
dependencies {

   implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
    
    }
```
3. For using Photoviewer module from a remote repository in separate application, add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.
```
dependencies {

 implementation 'dev.applibgroup:photo_viewer:1.0.0'
 testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
 
 }
```

## Usage

Refer to the ability_main.xml file in the entry sample app.

Create a Image in your layout file by adding the following XML tag:

``` xml
    <com.example.photo_viewer.Photoviewer
        ohos:id="$+id:image"
        ohos:height="match_parent"
        ohos:width="match_parent"
        ohos:image_src="$media:img"
        ohos:clickable="true"/>
```
You can give any image of our choice by adding an image in media folder.

Path as follows:

Entry->src->main->resources->base->media

Suppose you have added image file name as (sample.png) you need to change in xml as follows:
``` xml
  ohos:image_src="$media:sample"
```
